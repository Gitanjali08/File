### Analytics Assignment 1: End-to-End Statistical Model Building Exercise

#### Overview

This report presents an end-to-end statistical model-building exercise using a sample dataset. The steps include data preprocessing, descriptive analysis (exploratory data analysis), hypothesis building, model fitting, model validation, and interpretation of results. For this exercise, we will use the "Heart Disease" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

#### Step 1: Data Preprocessing

1. **Load the Data:**
   - Load the dataset into Weka. The dataset contains attributes related to heart disease diagnosis.

2. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Replace missing values using `unsupervised.attribute.ReplaceMissingValues` filter.

3. **Normalize Attributes:**
   - Normalize numerical attributes to ensure they are on a similar scale using the `unsupervised.attribute.Normalize` filter.

4. **Remove Unnecessary Attributes:**
   - Remove non-informative attributes like patient ID using the `unsupervised.attribute.Remove` filter.

5. **Discretize Numeric Attributes:**
   - Discretize continuous attributes into bins if necessary using `unsupervised.attribute.Discretize`.

#### Step 2: Descriptive Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis)

1. **Summary Statistics:**
   - Generate summary statistics for each attribute, including mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize the distribution of each attribute using histograms.
   - Create scatter plots to identify potential relationships between pairs of attributes.
   - Use box plots to detect outliers.

3. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Compute the correlation matrix to identify highly correlated features.

#### Step 3: Hypothesis Building

1. **Formulate Hypotheses:**
   - Hypothesis 1: Higher cholesterol levels are associated with an increased risk of heart disease.
   - Hypothesis 2: Older age is associated with a higher likelihood of heart disease.
   - Hypothesis 3: Males are more likely to develop heart disease than females.

#### Step 4: Model Fitting

1. **Select Classification Algorithm:**
   - Choose `LogisticRegression` from the "Classify" tab in Weka for predicting the presence of heart disease.

2. **Configure Parameters:**
   - Set parameters if necessary.

3. **Train-Test Split:**
   - Split the data into training (70%) and test (30%) sets.

4. **Train the Model:**
   - Train the logistic regression model on the training set.

5. **Evaluate the Model:**
   - Evaluate the model on the test set to obtain performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### Step 5: Model Validation

1. **Cross-Validation:**
   - Perform 10-fold cross-validation to assess the modelâ€™s performance.

2. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Record metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

3. **Confusion Matrix:**
   - Generate and analyze the confusion matrix to understand the distribution of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

#### Step 6: Interpretation of Results

1. **Interpret Coefficients:**
   - Interpret the coefficients of the logistic regression model to understand the impact of each feature on the likelihood of heart disease.

2. **Hypothesis Testing:**
   - Test the formulated hypotheses using the model results.
   - Hypothesis 1: Check the coefficient and p-value for cholesterol.
   - Hypothesis 2: Check the coefficient and p-value for age.
   - Hypothesis 3: Check the coefficient and p-value for gender.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Summarize the findings and conclusions from the analysis.
   - Discuss the implications of the results for predicting heart disease.
   - Highlight any limitations of the study and potential areas for further research.

### Example Workflow: Heart Disease Dataset

1. **Load Dataset:** `heart_disease.csv`.
2. **Preprocess Data:** Replace missing values, normalize attributes, remove non-informative attributes, and discretize continuous attributes.
3. **Descriptive Analysis:** Generate summary statistics, visualizations, and correlation matrix.
4. **Build Hypotheses:** Formulate hypotheses regarding cholesterol, age, and gender.
5. **Model Fitting:** Train logistic regression model, evaluate on test set.
6. **Model Validation:** Perform cross-validation, analyze confusion matrix.
7. **Interpret Results:** Interpret coefficients, test hypotheses, summarize findings.

This comprehensive process ensures a robust and accurate statistical model, providing insights into the factors influencing heart disease and demonstrating the efficacy of logistic regression in predictive modeling.
